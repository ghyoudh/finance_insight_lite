Key financial results
“Aramco’s ability to adapt to new market realities has once again been demonstrated by our strong third quarter 
performance. We increased production with minimal incremental cost, and reliably supplied the oil, gas and 
associated products our customers depend on, driving strong financial performance and quarterly earnings growth.
   
“We also continue to enhance our upstream capabilities, with major oil and gas projects either recently completed 
or due to come onstream soon. Today we announce higher sales gas forecasts, and we now target sales gas 
production capacity growth of approximately 80% between 2021 and 2030, capitalizing on advanced capabilities. 
Part of that is from our unconventional gas expansion at Jafurah, which attracted significant interest from global 
investors.
“Our strategy remains focused on value-accretive growth while meeting rising demand for energy, achieving 
even closer integration across our business, and leveraging advances in technology to unlock new commercial 
opportunities. Our deployment of advanced AI solutions and investment in digital infrastructure underpins this 
approach, and our plan to acquire a significant minority stake in HUMAIN is expected to further drive innovation 
and progress our role in the crucial and rapidly evolving AI sector.“

Saudi Aramco I Third quarter and nine months interim report 2025
Aramco’s results of operations and cash flows are primarily driven 
by market prices and volumes sold of hydrocarbons as well as 
refined and chemical products. 
Key factors affecting Aramco’s financial results for the nine 
months ended September 30, 2025 
Shareholders’ returns
•	During the first nine months of 2025, the Company paid base 
dividends of  ﷼237.86 billion ($63.4 billion), and performance-
linked dividends of  ﷼2.47 billion ($0.7 billion). These dividend 
payments, aggregating to  ﷼240.3 billion ($64.1 billion), reflect 
Aramco’s drive to deliver value and share the upside of its 
financial performance with shareholders.
“Aramco’s unrivaled capacity and ability to quickly ramp-up production and capture rising 
demand drove our strong third quarter performance, with adjusted net income up 14% and 
free cash flow up 55% from the previous quarter. Our recent $3.0 billion Sukuk issuance drew 
broad participation from leading international institutional investors, and we closed the Jafurah 
midstream deal with a consortium of foreign investors, underscoring investor confidence in our 
robust balance sheet and long-term strategy.”
Ziad T. Al-Murshed
Executive Vice President & CFO
Investment in affiliates
•	In January, Aramco completed the acquisition of a 50% equity 
interest in BHIG, a wholly-owned subsidiary of APQ. Following 
the initial investment in January, subsequent investments were 
made during the year, resulting in a total investment of  ﷼1.0 
billion ($0.27 billion). The transaction resulted in a reduction in 
cash and cash equivalents, and a corresponding increase in 
investments in joint ventures and associates.
•	In January, Aramco and Sumitomo completed the waiver of the 
remaining amounts of their respective shareholder loans to 
Petro Rabigh of  ﷼0.9 billion ($0.24 billion) each. As a result, 
Aramco derecognized its loan receivable, amounting to  ﷼0.9 
billion ($0.24 billion), and recorded an addition to its equity 
investment in Petro Rabigh. This resulted in a decrease in 
non-current other assets and receivables, and a corresponding 
increase in investments in joint ventures and associates. 
Subsequent to the nine months ended September 30, 2025, in 
October, Aramco completed the acquisition of an additional 
22.5% stake of class A shares with voting rights in Petro Rabigh 
from Sumitomo for  ﷼2.6 billion ($0.7 billion). As part of the 
transaction, Petro Rabigh issued a new class of non-voting class 
B shares to Aramco and Sumitomo for  ﷼2.6 billion ($0.7 billion) 
each.
•	In September, Aramco recognized an initial investment of  ﷼2.3 
billion ($0.6 billion) related to an integrated refining and 
petrochemical complex in Fujian province, China, and 
established Fujian Sinopec Aramco Refining and Petrochemical 
Co. Ltd. joint venture. This resulted in an increase in investments 
in joint ventures and associates, and a corresponding increase in 
trade payables and other liabilities.

Portfolio optimization
•	In February, SABIC completed the sale of its 20.62% 
shareholding in ALBA to Ma’aden for proceeds of 
approximately  ﷼3.6 billion ($0.96 billion). Upon receipt of the 
proceeds, the carrying amount of the investment in ALBA of 	
 ﷼3.3 billion ($0.88 billion) was derecognized and the difference 
was recognized as a gain in the consolidated statement of 
income. This resulted in an increase in cash and cash equivalents 
and a decrease in assets classified as held for sale in the 
consolidated balance sheet.
•	During the first nine months of 2025, SABIC received  ﷼3.2 
billion ($0.85 billion) of the deferred consideration related to 
the sale of Hadeed to PIF in 2024. This resulted in an increase in 
cash and cash equivalents, and a decrease in current other 
assets and receivables. In addition, the remaining amount of the 
deferred consideration of  ﷼1.9 billion ($0.5 billion) was 
reclassified from non-current other assets and receivables to 
current other assets and receivables.

Saudi Aramco I Third quarter and nine months interim report 2025
•	In June, Aramco announced the completion of an international 
bond issuance aggregating to an equivalent of  ﷼18.8 billion 
($5.0 billion) under its GMTN Programme. The issuance consists 
of three tranches, with the first tranche of  ﷼5.63 billion ($1.5 
billion) with five-year maturities and a 4.75% coupon rate, a 
second tranche of  ﷼4.69 billion ($1.25 billion) with 10-year 
maturities and a 5.375% coupon rate, and a third tranche of 	
 ﷼8.44 billion ($2.25 billion) with 30-year maturities and a 
6.375% coupon rate. The notes were listed on the London Stock 
Exchange’s Main Market. This resulted in an increase in cash 
and cash equivalents, and a corresponding increase in 
borrowings.
•	During the first nine months of 2025, SATORP made drawdowns 
of  ﷼7.3 billion ($1.9 billion) in relation to its external long-term 
debt financing arrangements, of which Aramco’s share was 	
 ﷼4.6 billion ($1.2 billion). This resulted in an increase in 
borrowings and a corresponding increase in cash and cash 
equivalents during the period.
•	In September, Aramco announced the completion of an 
international Sukuk issuance aggregating to an equivalent of 	
 ﷼11.3 billion ($3.0 billion) under its Trust Certificate Issuance 
Programme. The issuance was split into two tranches, with the 
first tranche of  ﷼5.63 billion ($1.5 billion) carrying a 4.125% 
profit rate and maturing in 2030, and a second tranche of 	
 ﷼5.63 billion ($1.5 billion) carrying a 4.625% profit rate and 
maturing in 2035. The securities were listed on the London 
Stock Exchange’s Main Market. This resulted in an increase in 
cash and cash equivalents, and an increase in borrowings.
For non-IFRS measures, refer to the Non-IFRS measures 
reconciliations and definitions section.
Financing arrangements
•	In March, SATORP, a joint operation of Aramco, entered into an 
asset transfer transaction with BHIG, a joint venture of Aramco, 
for upfront cash proceeds of  ﷼1.5 billion ($0.4 billion), of which 
Aramco’s share was  ﷼0.9 billion ($0.24 billion). As part of the 
transaction, SATORP transferred the ownership of a hydrogen 
manufacturing plant to BHIG and concurrently entered into a 
long-term hydrogen offtake agreement. This transaction, 
accounted for as a financing arrangement, resulted in an 
increase in cash and cash equivalents, and a corresponding 
increase in borrowings.
•	In March, Aramco received the final tranche of  ﷼2.0 billion 
($0.53 billion) related to the financing arrangement with JIGPC, 
of which Aramco recognized an amount of  ﷼1.6 billion ($0.43 
billion), representing the amount due to the other shareholders 
of JIGPC. This resulted in an increase in cash and cash 
equivalents and an increase in borrowings.
•	In March, Aramco extended the maturity date of its Sukuk 
issued in 2017 with a par value of  ﷼11.3 billion ($3.0 billion). 
The Sukuk, with a maturity date of April 10, 2025, was extended 
to April 10, 2032, with an option to redeem early on October 10, 
2031. This resulted in a reclassification of the Sukuk balance 
from current to non-current borrowings.
•	In March, SABIC refinanced a portion of its Murabaha loans 
resulting in proceeds of  ﷼8.1 billion ($2.16 billion), which were 
used for settlement of certain existing loans and will be 
repayable in installments over a period of 10 years. This resulted 
in an increase in cash and cash equivalents and an increase in 
borrowings.

3rd quarter 2025 vs 2nd quarter 2025
Revenue and other income related to sales for the third quarter of 
2025 was  ﷼418,160 ($111,509) compared to  ﷼407,142 ($108,572) 
for the second quarter of 2025, due to higher revenue and higher 
other income related to sales.
The increase in revenue was mainly due to higher volumes sold and 
prices of refined and chemical products, as well as higher prices and 
volumes sold of crude oil.
The increase in other income related to sales was due to higher price 
equalization compensation mainly resulting from higher reference 
equalization prices, and higher volumes sold of crude oil and 
refined products.
Operating costs for the third quarter of 2025 were  ﷼224,640 
($59,904) compared to  ﷼240,050 ($64,014) for the second quarter 
of 2025, mainly due to lower purchases.
                   
The decrease in purchases primarily reflects the impact of lower 
volumes purchased of crude oil, partially offset by higher prices and 
volumes of refined and chemical products purchased.
Net income for the third quarter of 2025 was  ﷼101,015 ($26,937) 
compared to  ﷼85,022 ($22,673) for the second quarter of 2025. The 
increase was mainly due to the impact of higher revenue and other 
income related to sales, as well as lower operating costs. This was 
partially offset by higher income taxes and zakat driven by higher 
taxable income.
The increase in adjusted net income was mainly due to the 
same factors as net income, excluding the impact of adjusting 
items. Please refer to the Non-IFRS measures reconciliations and 
definitions section for further details.

2025 was  ﷼418,160 ($111,509) compared to  ﷼464,625 ($123,900) 
for the third quarter of 2024. The decrease was due to lower 
revenue and lower other income related to sales.
The decrease in revenue was mainly driven by lower refined and 
chemical products prices as well as lower crude oil prices and traded 
volumes, partially offset by higher volumes sold of refined and 
chemical products.
The decrease in other income related to sales was due to lower price 
equalization compensation mainly resulting from higher regulated 
prices, lower reference equalization prices, and lower volumes sold 
of crude oil and refined products.
Operating costs for the third quarter of 2025 were  ﷼224,640 
($59,904) compared to  ﷼271,810 ($72,483) for the third quarter 
of 2024. The decrease was mainly due to lower purchases and 
lower production royalties, partially offset by higher producing and 
manufacturing expenses and higher selling, administrative and 
general expenses.
The decrease in purchases primarily reflects the impact of lower 
volumes purchased of crude oil and lower prices of refined and 
chemical products purchased, partially offset by higher volumes 
purchased of refined and chemical products.
Lower production royalties were predominantly driven by lower 
average effective royalty rate and lower crude oil prices.
Producing and manufacturing expenses increased primarily due to 
unfavorable inventory valuation movement, and higher utilities and 
other costs. 
The increase in selling, administrative and general expenses was 
primarily driven by losses associated with derivative instruments. 
Net income for the third quarter of 2025 was  ﷼101,015 ($26,937) 
compared to  ﷼103,365 ($27,564) for the third quarter of 2024. The

 ﷼1,373,083 ($366,156) for the first nine months of 2024. The 
decrease was due to lower revenue and lower other income related 
to sales.
The decrease in revenue was mainly due to lower prices of crude 
oil as well as lower prices of refined and chemical products. This 
was partially offset by higher volumes sold of refined and chemical 
products.
The decrease in other income related to sales was driven by lower

Saudi Aramco I Third quarter and nine months interim report 2025
Aramco demonstrated ongoing safe, reliable, and efficient 
operations, while achieving total hydrocarbon production of 13.3 
mmboed in the third quarter of 2025.
During the quarter, Aramco increased its sales gas production 
capacity growth target from more than 60% to approximately 
80%1. With this anticipated growth, Aramco also expects an 
increase of more than one mmbpd in high value associated liquids 
production. As a result, the Company anticipates total gas and 
associated liquids of approximately six mmboed by 2030.
Aramco also progressed several developments to support its gas 
expansion strategy:
•	Phase one of the Jafurah Gas Plant, part of the Jafurah 
unconventional gas field development, continued construction 
activities and is on track for completion in 2025. Production is 
expected to reach a sustainable sales gas rate of 2.0 bscfd by 
2030, in addition to significant volumes of ethane, NGL, and 
condensate;
•	The Tanajib Gas Plant, part of the Marjan development program,

in 2025, with the expected addition of 2.6 bscfd of raw gas 
processing capacity from the Marjan and Zuluf fields;
•	The Fadhili Gas Plant expansion, which is expected to increase 
raw gas processing capacity of 1.5 bscfd by 2027, continued with 
engineering, procurement, and construction activities; and,
•	In October, the Company closed a transaction to lease and lease 
back the development and usage rights to the Jafurah Field Gas 
Plant and the Riyas NGL Fractionation Plant to its subsidiary, 
Jafurah Midstream Gas Company, for a period of 20 years. As 
part of the transaction, Aramco sold a 49% equity interest in the 
subsidiary to a consortium of international investors led by 
funds managed by Global Infrastructure Partners, a part of 
BlackRock, for upfront sale proceeds of  ﷼41.8 billion ($11.1 
billion) in cash. During the 20-year lease period, the subsidiary 
will receive quarterly volume-based tariff payments from 
Aramco, backed by minimum volume commitments. Aramco 
will at all times retain title and full operational control of the 
facilities, and the transaction will not impose any restrictions on 
its production volumes.    
The Company advanced the following increment projects to 
support its ability to maintain MSC at 12.0 mmbpd, while 
strengthening its unique ability to respond swiftly to changing

In the third quarter of 2025, Aramco continued to expand its global 
downstream presence through strategic international investments, 
and reinforced its position as a trusted partner in refining and 
petrochemicals. In the first nine months of the year, Downstream 
utilized approximately 54% of Aramco’s crude oil production, and 
the Company maintained its excellent reputation for dependable 
operations with supply reliability of 99.9%. 
Key Downstream developments in the quarter include the 
following:
 
•	Aramco made an initial investment in the integrated refining 
and petrochemical complex in Fujian province, China, and, with 
its partners Sinopec (25%) and Fujian Petrochemical Company 
Limited (50%), established Fujian Sinopec Aramco Refining and 
Petrochemical Co. Ltd. The joint venture, in which Aramco holds 
a 25% interest, will drive development of the facility which 
includes a 320 mbpd refinery, a 1.5 mmtpa ethylene unit, a 
300,000 ton crude oil terminal, and capacity to produce 2.0 
mmtpa of paraxylene and downstream derivatives. The project, 
which is expected to be completed in 2030, aims to create a 
world-class integrated petrochemical facility; 
•	Aramco’s acquisition of a 25% equity stake in Unioil Petroleum 
Philippines Ltd. (Unioil) was successfully completed in October, 
following receipt of the required regulatory approvals. Through 
this acquisition, Aramco continues to progress its strategic 
expansion of its global retail network in high-value markets. 
Unioil is one of the largest petroleum companies in the 
Philippines with over 175 retail stations and four storage 
terminals; and,
•	In October, Aramco completed the acquisition of an additional 
stake of approximately 22.5% in Petro Rabigh, an integrated 
refining and petrochemical complex in the Kingdom, from 
Sumitomo for  ﷼2.6 billion ($0.7 billion). Following the 
transaction, Aramco’s equity stake in Petro Rabigh increased to 
approximately 60%, making it the largest shareholder while 
Sumitomo retained a 15% stake. The transaction also includes 
transfer of the marketing rights of Petro Rabigh’s products 
currently held by Sumitomo and its affiliates to Aramco and its 
affiliates. As a result, Aramco and its affiliates will hold all rights 
to market Petro Rabigh’s products. The transaction demonstrates 
Aramco’s support of its partners and affiliates, aligning with its 
downstream strategy that fosters value creation, business 
integration, and portfolio diversification. The move also 
strengthens Aramco’s capacity to support the ongoing 
transformation program at Petro Rabigh, which includes 
targeted asset upgrades aimed at increasing the yield of 
high-margin products and enhancing plant reliability.

Technology and innovation highlights
In October, Aramco and PIF announced the signing of a non-
binding term sheet that would see Aramco acquire a significant 
minority stake in HUMAIN, a PIF company, with PIF retaining 
majority ownership. The proposed plan would unify PIF’s 
and Aramco’s AI assets, capabilities, and talent to enable the 
rapid scaling up of HUMAIN’s operations to capture value and 
accelerate its growth in the AI sector. HUMAIN provides a range of 
AI products and services, including next-generation data centers, 
cloud capabilities, and advanced AI models and solutions. The 
non-binding term sheet is subject to the signing of definitive 
agreements, applicable regulatory approvals, and other customary 
conditions. 
During the quarter, Aramco expanded its satellite communication 
capabilities by utilizing Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites capable of 
transmitting large volumes of data in a shorter period compared 
to traditional Geo Orbit satellites. The LEO satellites can power 
real-time advisory systems and are expected to drive productivity 
gains across various processes. Aramco’s satellite network provides 
connectivity to approximately 500 remote onshore and offshore 
sites and platforms.
As part of its energy transition framework, Aramco seeks to 
improve the sustainability of its operations and increase energy 
efficiency across its Upstream and Downstream assets. During the 
quarter, the Company successfully deployed solar energy storage 
technologies at a remote, unmanned site using hydrogen-based 
fuel cell technology and Aramco-patented iron-vanadium flow 
batteries. The initiative demonstrated the operational reliability 
and resilience of these technologies in challenging environments 
and marks a step forward in the Company’s efforts to enhance the 
sustainability and energy efficiency of its operations.
In October, Aramco completed a Joint Development Agreement 
with Honeywell and the King Abdullah University of Science and 
Technology (KAUST) to co-develop a cutting-edge, direct crude-
to-chemicals technology. This collaborative effort aims to optimize 
the crude-to-chemicals conversion process, reducing both 
capital and operating expenses. The new technology is designed 
to optimize the value of each barrel of crude oil by directly 
converting it into high-demand chemicals such as light olefins. By 
streamlining the process, this innovation is expected to enhance 
fuel efficiency, carbon utilization, and overall process economics, 
ultimately enabling more efficient and cost-effective large-scale 
production.

Saudi Aramco I Third quarter and nine months interim report 2025
3rd quarter 2025 vs 2nd quarter 2025 
Free cash flow for the third quarter of 2025 was  ﷼88,364 
($23,563) compared to  ﷼57,126 ($15,233) for the previous 
quarter. The increase was attributable to higher net cash provided 
by operating activities, while capital expenditures remained 
relatively consistent with the previous quarter.
The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was 
primarily driven by higher earnings and favorable movements 
in working capital as well as a reduction in cash paid for the 
settlement of income, zakat and other taxes.
3rd quarter 2025 vs 3rd quarter 2024
Free cash flow for the third quarter of 2025 was  ﷼88,364 
($23,563) compared to  ﷼82,465 ($21,990) for the same quarter 
last year. The increase was attributable to higher net cash 
provided by operating activities, and lower capital expenditures. 
The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was 
mainly due to a reduction in cash paid for the settlement of 
income, zakat and other taxes. This was partially offset by 
unfavorable movement in working capital.
The decrease in capital expenditures was predominantly due 
to lower Upstream capital expenditures compared to the same 
period of the previous year.
Nine months 2025 vs Nine months 2024 
Free cash flow for the first nine months of 2025 was  ﷼217,339 
($57,956) compared to  ﷼238,908 ($63,709) for the first nine 
months of 2024. The decrease was attributable to lower net cash 
provided by operating activities and higher capital expenditures.
The reduction in net cash provided by operating activities was 
primarily driven by lower earnings and unfavorable movements in 
working capital, partially offset by lower outflows from changes 
in other assets and receivables, and a reduction in cash paid for 
the settlement of income, zakat and other taxes.
The increase in capital expenditures was predominantly due to 
higher Downstream capital expenditures compared to the same 
period of the previous year.
This Interim Report includes certain non-IFRS financial measures 
(free cash flow, ROACE, gearing, EBIT, adjusted EBIT, and adjusted 
net income), which Aramco uses to make informed decisions 
about its financial position and operating performance or 
liquidity. These non-IFRS financial measures have been included in 
this Interim Report to facilitate a better understanding of Aramco’s 
historical trends of operation and financial position. 
Aramco uses non-IFRS financial measures as supplementary 
information to its IFRS-based operating performance and 
financial position. The non-IFRS financial measures are not 
defined by, or presented in accordance with, IFRS. The non-IFRS 
financial measures are not measurements of Aramco’s operating 
performance or liquidity under IFRS and should not be used 
instead of, or considered as alternatives to, any measures of 
performance or liquidity under IFRS. The non-IFRS financial 
measures relate to the reporting periods described in this Interim 
Report and are not intended to be predictive of future results.
In addition, other companies, including those in Aramco’s 
industry, may calculate similarly titled non-IFRS financial measures 
differently from Aramco. Because companies do not necessarily 
calculate these non-IFRS financial measures in the same manner, 
Aramco’s presentation of such non-IFRS financial measures may 
not be comparable to other similarly titled non-IFRS financial 
measures used by other companies.

Gearing is a measure of the degree to which Aramco’s operations 
are financed by debt and reflects available liquidity held in 
current and non-current investments and cash management 
instruments. Aramco defines gearing as the ratio of net debt 
(cash) (total borrowings less cash and cash equivalents, short-term 
investments, total investment in debt securities, and non-current 
cash investments) to total equity and net debt (cash). Management 
believes that gearing is widely used by analysts and investors in 
the oil and gas industry to indicate a company’s financial health 
and flexibility.
3rd quarter 2025 vs 2nd quarter 2025  
Aramco’s gearing ratio as at September 30, 2025, was 6.3% which 
was relatively consistent with 6.5% as at June 30, 2025. 
3rd quarter 2025 vs 3rd quarter 2024 
Aramco’s gearing ratio as at September 30, 2025, was 6.3% 
compared to 1.9% as at September 30, 2024. The increase 
in gearing was principally driven by the change in net debt 
(cash) position mainly reflecting dividend payments and capital 
expenditures, partially offset by operating cash inflows during the 
period.

Saudi Aramco I Third quarter and nine months interim report 2025
3rd quarter 2025 vs 2nd quarter 2025 
Adjusted net income for the third quarter of 2025 was  ﷼104,923 
($27,979) compared to  ﷼92,041 ($24,544) for the previous 
quarter. The increase was mainly due to the impact of higher 
revenue and other income related to sales and a decrease in 
purchases, partially offset by higher income taxes and zakat.
3rd quarter 2025 vs 3rd quarter 2024
Adjusted net income for the third quarter of 2025 was  ﷼104,923 
($27,979) compared to  ﷼103,997 ($27,733) for the same quarter 
in 2024. The increase was mainly driven by lower purchases and 
lower production royalties. This was partially offset by lower 
revenue and other income related to sales, higher producing and 
manufacturing expenses, and higher selling, administrative and 
general expenses.     
Nine months 2025 vs Nine months 2024
Adjusted net income for the first nine months of 2025 was 	
 ﷼295,679 ($78,847) compared to  ﷼316,044 ($84,279) for the first 
nine months of 2024. The decrease was mainly due to the impact 
of lower revenue and other income related to sales, and higher 
producing and manufacturing expenses. This was partially offset 
by lower purchases and lower production royalties, as well as 
lower income taxes and zakat.

Adjusted net income
Aramco defines adjusted net income as net income excluding the 
impact of adjusting items, adjusting items related to finance costs, 
and tax and zakat adjustments. Aramco believes that adjusted net 
income is a useful measure that enables analysts and investors to 
evaluate its operational and financial performance by excluding 
the impact of one-off, non-operating and non-recurring items.

Technical terms
CO2
Carbon dioxide.
Condensate
Light hydrocarbon substances produced 
with raw gas which condenses into liquid 
at normal temperatures and pressures 
associated with surface production 
equipment.
Hydrocarbons
Crude oil and other hydrogen and carbon 
compounds in liquid or gaseous state.
Liquids
Crude oil, condensate, and NGL.
MSC 
Maximum Sustainable Capacity – the 
average maximum number of barrels per 
day of crude oil that can be produced 
for one year during any future planning 
period, after taking into account all 
planned capital expenditures and 
maintenance, repair and operating costs, 
and after being given three months to 
make operational adjustments. The MSC 
excludes AGOC’s crude oil production 
capacity.
Natural gas
Methane produced at Aramco’s gas plants 
and sold within the Kingdom as sales gas.
NGL
Natural gas liquids, which are liquid or 
liquefied hydrocarbons produced in the 
manufacture, purification, and stabilization 
of natural gas. For the reporting of 
reserves, ethane is included in NGL. For the 
reporting of production, NGL is included 
in total liquids, and ethane is reported as a 
component of total gas.
Supply reliability
Total products volume shipped/delivered 
within 24 hours of the scheduled time, 
divided by the total products volume 
committed. Any delays caused by factors 
that are under the Company’s control 
(e.g. terminal, pipeline, stabilization, or 
production) negatively affect the score, 
whereas delays caused by conditions that 
are beyond the Company’s control, such 
as adverse weather, are not considered. 
A score of less than 100% indicates there 
were issues that negatively impacted 
reliability.

operations and business and certain of Aramco’s plans, intentions, 
expectations, assumptions, goals and beliefs regarding such

“anticipates”, “intends”, “estimates”, “should”, “will”, “shall”, 
“may”, “is likely to”, “plans”, “outlook” or similar expressions, 
including variations and the negatives thereof or comparable

Investors and prospective investors should be aware that forward-
looking statements are not guarantees of future performance 
and that Aramco’s actual financial position, results of operations

operates may differ significantly from those made in or suggested 
by these forward-looking statements. In addition, even if 
Aramco’s financial position, results of operations and business 
and the development of the industries in which it operates are 
consistent with these forward-looking statements, those results or 
developments may not be indicative of results or developments in 
subsequent periods.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from 
Aramco’s expectations are contained in cautionary statements 
in this Interim Report and include, among other things, the 
following:
•	Global supply, demand and price fluctuations of oil, gas and 
petrochemicals;
•	Global economic conditions;
•	Competition in the industries in which Aramco operates;
•	Climate change concerns, weather conditions and related 
impacts on the global demand for hydrocarbons and 
hydrocarbon-based products, as well as risks related to Aramco’s 
ESG goals and targets;
•	Conditions affecting the transportation of products;
•	Operational risk and hazards common in the oil and gas, 
refining and petrochemicals industries;
•	The cyclical nature of the oil and gas, refining and 
petrochemicals industries;
•	Political and social instability and unrest, and actual or potential 
armed conflicts in the MENA region and other areas;
•	Natural disasters and public health pandemics or epidemics;
•	The management of Aramco’s growth;
•	The management of the Company’s subsidiaries, joint 
operations, joint ventures, associates and entities in which it 
holds a minority interest;
•	Aramco’s exposure to inflation, interest rate risk and foreign 
exchange risk;
•	Risks related to operating in a regulated industry and changes to 
oil, gas, environmental or other regulations that impact the 
industries in which Aramco operates; 
•	Legal proceedings, international trade matters, and other 
disputes or agreements; and,
•	Risks related to the Kingdom.
For a discussion of our risk factors, please see Aramco’s Annual 
Report 2024, available through the investor relations section of 
Aramco’s website at 
www.aramco.com/en/investors/reports-and-presentations.
Our forward-looking statements speak as of the date of this 
report or the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation 
to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether 
as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 
All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements 
attributable to us or to persons acting on our behalf are expressly 
qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements referred to 
above and our risk factors in our Annual Report and statements

Aramco’s financial information herein has been extracted from 
Aramco’s condensed consolidated interim financial report 
for the nine month period ended September 30, 2025, which 
is prepared and presented in accordance with IAS 34, that is 
endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and other standards and 
pronouncements issued by the Saudi Organization for Chartered 
and Professional Accountants (“SOCPA”). Financial information 
contained in this Interim Report is converted at a fixed rate of 
U.S. dollar 1.00 = SAR 3.75 for convenience only. The numbers 
presented throughout this Interim Report may not sum precisely to 
the totals provided, and percentages may not precisely reflect the 
absolute figures, due to rounding.
In addition, this document includes certain “non-IFRS financial 
measures”. These measures are not recognized measures under 
IFRS and do not have standardized meanings prescribed by IFRS. 
Rather, these measures are provided as additional information to 
complement IFRS measures by providing further understanding 
of Aramco’s results of operations, cash flow and financial position 
from management’s perspective. Accordingly, they should not be 
considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of Aramco’s 
financial information reported under IFRS.
A reconciliation of non-IFRS measures is included in the Non-
IFRS measures reconciliations and definitions section of this 
Interim Report. The Company may revise the definitions of 
non-IFRS financial measures, introduce new financial measures, 
or discontinue their use altogether in future reporting periods. 
Furthermore, this report may include non-IFRS financial 
measures not used in prior reports, making it difficult to compare 
performance of such measures with past periods.

Report on review of the condensed consolidated interim financial 
report 
 
To the shareholders of Saudi Arabian Oil Company 
 
Introduction 
 
We have reviewed the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet of Saudi Arabian Oil Company and 
its subsidiaries as at September 30, 2025 and the related condensed consolidated statements of income, 
comprehensive income and cash flows for the three-month and nine-month periods then ended and the 
condensed consolidated statement of changes in equity for the nine-month period then ended and other 
explanatory notes (the “condensed consolidated interim financial report”). Management is responsible for the 
preparation and presentation of this condensed consolidated interim financial report in accordance with 
International Accounting Standard 34, ‘Interim Financial Reporting’, that is endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi 
Arabia. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on this condensed consolidated interim financial report 
based on our review. 
 
Scope of review 
 
We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements 2410, ‘Review of 
interim financial information performed by the independent auditor of the entity’, that is endorsed in the 
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of 
persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. 
A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on 
Auditing, that are endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and consequently does not enable us to obtain 
assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. 
Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. 
 
Conclusion 
 
Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying 
condensed consolidated interim financial report is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with 
International Accounting Standard 34, ‘Interim Financial Reporting’, that is endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi 
Arabia.

32   Saudi Aramco I Third quarter and nine months interim report 2025 
Notes to the condensed consolidated interim financial report 
1. General information 
The Saudi Arabian Oil Company (the “Company”), with headquarters located in Dhahran, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (the “Kingdom”), 
is engaged in prospecting, exploring, drilling and extracting hydrocarbon substances (“Upstream”) and processing, manufacturing, 
refining and marketing these hydrocarbon substances (“Downstream”). The Company was formed on November 13, 1988 by Royal 
Decree No. M/8; however, its history dates back to May 29, 1933 when the Saudi Arabian Government (the “Government”) granted a 
concession to the Company’s predecessor for the right to, among other things, explore the Kingdom for hydrocarbons. Effective 
January 1, 2018, the Council of Ministers Resolution No. 180, dated 1/4/1439H (December 19, 2017), converted the Company to a 
Saudi Joint Stock Company with new Bylaws. 
 
On December 11, 2019, the Company completed its Initial Public Offering (“IPO”) and its ordinary shares were listed on the Saudi 
Exchange. In connection with the IPO, the Government, being the sole owner of the Company’s shares at such time, sold an 
aggregate of 3.45 billion ordinary shares, or 1.73% of the Company’s share capital. 
 
On February 13, 2022, the Government transferred 4% of the Company's issued shares to the Public Investment Fund ("PIF"), the 
sovereign wealth fund of the Kingdom, followed by another transfer of 4% on April 16, 2023 to Saudi Arabian Investment Company 
("Sanabil Investments"), a wholly-owned company of PIF. Further, on March 7, 2024, the Government transferred an additional 8% 
of the Company’s issued shares to PIF’s wholly-owned companies. Furthermore, on June 11, 2024, the Government completed a 
secondary public offering of the Company’s ordinary shares. In connection with the secondary offering, the Government sold an 
aggregate of approximately 1.7 billion shares, representing 0.7% of the Company’s issued shares. This includes 137.6 million ordinary 
shares acquired by the Company from the Government, which have been classified as treasury shares. Following the completion of 
the secondary offering, the Government remains the Company’s largest shareholder, retaining an 81.48% direct shareholding. 
 
The condensed consolidated interim financial report of the Company and its subsidiaries (together “Saudi Aramco”) was approved by 
the Board of Directors on November 3, 2025. 
 
2. Basis of preparation and material accounting policy information 
The condensed consolidated interim financial report has been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 
(“IAS 34”), Interim Financial Reporting, that is endorsed in the Kingdom, and other standards and pronouncements issued by the 
Saudi Organization for Chartered and Professional Accountants (“SOCPA”). The accounting policies used in the preparation of this 
condensed consolidated interim financial report are consistent with those set out in Saudi Aramco’s consolidated financial statements 
for the year ended December 31, 2024. 
 
The results for the interim periods are unaudited and include all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the 
periods presented. This condensed consolidated interim financial report should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial 
statements and related notes for the year ended December 31, 2024, which have been prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) that are endorsed in the Kingdom, and other standards and pronouncements issued by SOCPA. 
The consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024, are also in compliance with IFRS as issued by the 
International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”).

3. Fair value estimation 
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market 
participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset 
or transfer the liability takes place either in the principal market for the asset or liability or, in the absence of a principal market, in 
the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. Management believes that the fair values of Saudi Aramco’s financial assets 
and liabilities that are measured and recognized at amortized cost are not materially different from their carrying amounts at the end 
of the reporting period. 
 
The following table presents Saudi Aramco’s financial assets and financial liabilities measured and recognized at fair value at 
September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, based on the prescribed fair value measurement hierarchy on a recurring basis. Saudi 
Aramco did not measure any financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value on a non-recurring basis at September 30, 2025 
and December 31, 2024. There were no changes made to any of the valuation techniques and valuation processes applied as of 
December 31, 2024 and changes in unobservable inputs are not expected to materially impact the fair values.

The changes in Level 3 investments in securities for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2025, and the year ended

The movement in trade receivables and trade payables related to contracts with provisional pricing arrangements mainly arises from 
sales and purchase transactions made during the period, net of settlements. Unrealized fair value movements on these trade 
receivables and trade payables are not significant. 
 
The change in the carrying amount of commodity derivative contracts primarily relates to purchase and sales of derivative contracts, 
including recognition of a gain or loss that results from adjusting a derivative to fair value. Fair value movements on commodity 
derivative contracts are not significant. 
 
The movements in financial assets – option rights, and financial liabilities – options and forward contracts, being put, call and 
forward contracts on equity instruments of certain non-wholly-owned subsidiaries, are mainly due to changes in the unrealized fair 
values of those contracts during the period. 
 
4. Operating segments 
Saudi Aramco is engaged in prospecting, exploring, drilling, extracting, processing, manufacturing, refining and marketing 
hydrocarbon substances within the Kingdom and has interests in refining, petrochemical, distribution, marketing and storage 
facilities outside the Kingdom. 
 
Saudi Aramco’s operating segments are established on the basis of those components that are evaluated regularly by the President & 
CEO, considered to be the Chief Operating Decision Maker. The Chief Operating Decision Maker monitors the operating results of 
Saudi Aramco’s operating segments separately for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance 
assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on revenues, costs and a broad range of key performance indicators in addition 
to segment profitability.

4. Operating segments continued 
For management purposes, Saudi Aramco is organized into business units based on the main types of activities. At September 30, 2025, 
Saudi Aramco had two reportable segments, Upstream and Downstream, with all other supporting functions aggregated into a 
Corporate segment. Upstream activities include crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids exploration, field development and 
production. Downstream activities consist primarily of refining and petrochemical manufacturing, supply and trading, base oils and 
lubricants, retail, distribution and power generation, logistics, and marketing of crude oil and related services to international and 
domestic customers. Corporate activities include primarily supporting services including Human Resources, Finance and IT, that are not 
allocated to Upstream and Downstream. Transfer prices between operating segments are on an arm’s length basis in a manner similar to 
transactions with third parties. 
 
Effective October 1, 2024, certain changes were made to the pricing basis of inter-segment transactions. Since December 31, 2024, 
there were no differences in the basis of segmentation or in the basis of measurement of segment earnings before interest, income 
taxes and zakat.

7. Income taxes and zakat 
(a) Kingdom income tax rates 
The Company is subject to an income tax rate of 20% on its Downstream activities and on the activities of exploration and production 
of non-associated natural gas, including gas condensates, as well as the collection, treatment, processing, fractionation and 
transportation of associated and non-associated natural gas and their liquids, gas condensates and other associated elements. All 
other activities are subject to an income tax rate of 50%, in accordance with the Saudi Arabian Income Tax Law of 2004 and its 
amendments (the “Tax Law”). The 20% income tax rate applicable to the Company’s Downstream activities came into effect on 
January 1, 2020. This was conditional on the Company separating its Downstream activities under the control of one or more separate 
wholly-owned subsidiaries before the due date of December 31, 2024, which has been extended to December 31, 2030, otherwise the 
Company’s Downstream activities will be retroactively taxed at 50%. The Company expects to transfer its Downstream activities in line 
with the applicable requirements within the specified period. 
 
Additionally, according to the Tax Law, shares held directly or indirectly in listed companies on the Saudi Exchange by taxpayers 
engaged in oil and hydrocarbon activities are exempt from the application of corporate income tax. As a result, the Company’s 
ownership interests in such companies are subject to zakat.

16. Investments in affiliates 
(a) Rabigh Refining and Petrochemical Company (“Petro Rabigh”) 
In January 2025, the Company and Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd. (“Sumitomo”), the founding shareholders of Petro Rabigh, 
completed the waiver of the remaining amounts of their respective shareholder loans to Petro Rabigh of approximately  ﷼938 each. 
This followed an initial waiver of  ﷼1,875 by each party in August 2024. The Company recognized the waiver of its shareholder loan 
receivable as an increase in the carrying amount of the investment in Petro Rabigh, an associate. 
 
On October 9, 2025, the Company announced the completion of the acquisition of an additional 22.5% stake in existing ordinary 
shares (“Class A Shares”) of Petro Rabigh from Sumitomo for  ﷼2,632 (Note 19(a)). Following the completion of the transaction, the 
Company became Petro Rabigh’s largest shareholder with an approximately 60% interest in Class A Shares with voting rights, 
Sumitomo’s holding reduced to 15%, while the public shareholding remained unchanged at 25%. 
 
As part of the transaction, on October 22, 2025, Petro Rabigh announced the completion of the issuance of a new class of non-voting 
shares (“Class B Shares”) to Sumitomo and the Company for  ﷼2,632 each. Consequently, the Company and Sumitomo each hold 50% 
of the non-voting Class B Shares (Note 19(a)).  
 
These transactions resulted in a total increase of  ﷼5,264 in the Company’s investment in Petro Rabigh in the fourth quarter of 2025. 
The Company continues to account for Petro Rabigh as an associate, as the agreements and constitutive documents provide the 
Company significant influence over the financial and operating policies of Petro Rabigh. 
 
(b) Fujian Sinopec Aramco Refining and Petrochemical Co., Ltd. (“FSARP”) 
On September 4, 2025, Aramco Asia Singapore Pte. Ltd (“AAS”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, along with China 
Petroleum & Chemical Corporation (“SINOPEC”) and Fujian Petrochemical Company Limited (“FPCL”) incorporated FSARP for the 
construction and operation of an integrated refining and petrochemical complex in the Fujian Province of China. AAS holds a 25% equity 
interest in FSARP, while FPCL and SINOPEC own 50% and 25%, respectively. Accordingly, an initial amount of  ﷼2,279 was recognized as 
an investment in joint venture in September 2025, which was subsequently paid on October 16, 2025. As at September 30, 2025, the 
outstanding commitment amounted to  ﷼3,793. 
 
The complex will consist of a 320,000 barrels per day refinery, a 1.5 million tons-per-year ethylene unit, a two million tons-per-
year paraxylene and downstream derivatives capacity, and a 300,000 tons crude oil terminal, and is expected to be operational by 
the end of 2030.

16. Investments in affiliates continued 
(c) Blue Hydrogen Industrial Gases Company (“BHIG”) 
On January 27, 2025, Saudi Aramco Development Company (“SADCO”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, closed the 
transaction to acquire a 50% equity interest in BHIG, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Air Products Qudra for Energy (“APQ”). BHIG, a 
company based in the Kingdom, aims to produce lower-carbon hydrogen while capturing and storing CO2. This investment highlights 
Saudi Aramco’s ambition to expand its new energies portfolio. Upon completion, SADCO invested an initial amount of  ﷼113 and the 
investment was recognized as a joint venture. A further investment of  ﷼891 was made during 2025, mainly representing SADCO’s 
share of additional capital contribution to BHIG in connection with the transfer of ownership of a hydrogen manufacturing plant from 
SATORP to BHIG (Note 9(c)(ii)). In addition, the Company has provided guarantees to external lenders for an amount of  ﷼1,441, 
representing SADCO’s share of BHIG’s existing borrowing facilities. 
 
17. Sale of equity interests in affiliates 
(a) Jafurah Midstream Gas Company (“JMGC”) 
On August 14, 2025, the Company signed a share sale and purchase agreement with Green Palm Bidco S.à r.l. (“Green Palm”) to sell a 
49% equity interest in JMGC, a newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, for upfront sale proceeds of  ﷼41,802 
($11,147) in cash. The closing of the transaction occurred on October 27, 2025 (Note 19(b)).  
 
Green Palm is an entity owned by a consortium of investors led by funds managed by Global Infrastructure Partners, a part of 
BlackRock, Inc. Green Palm, as a shareholder of JMGC, is entitled to receive distributions of its pro rata share of JMGC’s available cash 
when the Company pays discretionary dividends to its ordinary shareholders. Given the discretionary nature of distributions to Green 
Palm, in line with the principles of consolidation outlined in Note 2(d) of Saudi Aramco’s consolidated financial statements for the 
year ended December 31, 2024, Green Palm’s shareholding represents a non-controlling interest and, therefore, the upfront sale 
proceeds have been recognized as a non-controlling interest within equity in the fourth quarter of 2025. 
 
Immediately prior to the closing of the transaction, the Company leased the development and usage rights to the Jafurah Field Gas 
Plant and the Riyas NGL Fractionation Plant (“the Facilities”) to JMGC for a period of 20 years. Concurrently, JMGC granted the 
Company the exclusive rights to the Facilities to receive, process and treat raw gas from the Jafurah field during the 20-year period in 
exchange for a quarterly, volume-based tariff payable by the Company to JMGC. The tariff is backed by minimum volume 
commitments. The Company will at all times retain title to, and operational control of, the Facilities. 
 
(b) Saudi Iron and Steel Company (“Hadeed”) 
During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2025, SABIC received  ﷼3,173 in respect of the deferred consideration related to 
the sale of Hadeed to PIF in 2024. As at September 30, 2025, the remaining deferred consideration amounting to  ﷼1,929 is included 
within current other assets and receivables (December 31, 2024:  ﷼3,032 and  ﷼1,794 included within current and non-current other 
assets and receivables, respectively). 
 
(c) Aluminium Bahrain B.S.C. (“ALBA”) 
On February 19, 2025, SABIC announced the completion of the sale of its 20.62% shareholding in ALBA, an associate, to Saudi 
Arabian Mining Company (Ma'aden). The carrying amount of the investment in ALBA, amounting to  ﷼3,294 and classified as held 
for sale and presented separately on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2024, was derecognized. The sale proceeds of 
Bahraini Dinars 363 million (approximately  ﷼3,606) were received in cash and a gain of  ﷼342 was recognized in the condensed 
consolidated statement of income.
